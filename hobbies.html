            I use progressive overload<ul>
              <li>
                This is the process of slowly adding more and more weight so that your body is constantly challenged
              </li>
              <li>
                It's harder than it seems and progress is not linear
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            This helps keep my cardio to a minimum <ul>
